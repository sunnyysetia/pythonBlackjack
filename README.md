# Command Line Blackjack in Python

A Python implementation of the classic card game Blackjack, with a twist: it displays the cards visually in the terminal!

## How to Play

The game is easy to play, here's a quick step-by-step guide:
1. The dealer will deal two cards, both to you and themselves. One of the dealer's cards will be face up, while the other will be face down (the "hole" card).
2. Review your two cards and decide whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep your current total). The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
3. If you go over 21, you "bust" and lose the hand. If you're not bust, repeat step 2 as desired.
4. When you choose to stand, the dealer will reveal their hole card. The dealer must hit if their total is 16 or less, and must stand if their total is 17 or more.
5. If the dealer busts, you win. If the dealer doesn't bust, the player (you or the dealer) with the highest total that is less than or equal to 21 wins.
